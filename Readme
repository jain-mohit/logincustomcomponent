Readme:

Description:

LoginCustomComponent is a stand alone component which is used to save user's credentials based on user's need and choice. 
It allows user to save or unsave username and/or password in login screen. Credentials will be retained (if saved) even when application is 
killed and restarted. It is similar to the option of checkmark (to remember credentials) we have on websites.  

Relevant Files:

You need the LoginCustomComponentViewController.h, LoginCustomComponentViewController.m and LoginCustomComponentViewController.xib
files. You can either use buttonOff.png and buttonOn.png or use your own images for button save option.

How to use? 


1) Just import custom controller .h file and create an instance of custom controller.

Your Login Controller.h:

@class LoginCustomComponentViewController;

@property (nonatomic,strong)LoginCustomComponentViewController *loginComponent;


2) Login Controller.m:


#import "LoginCustomComponentViewController.h"


- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    loginComponent= [[LoginCustomComponentViewController alloc]initWithNibName:@"LoginCustomComponentViewController" bundle:nil];
    [self.view addSubview:loginComponent.view];
    
    [loginComponent.loginButton addTarget:self
                             action:@selector(login:)
       forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
    
    //Edit UI element properties as required or add more UI view on top of loginComponent
    //Example:
    //loginComponent.username.textColor = [UIColor redColor];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view from its nib.
}
